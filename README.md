# carbonFoots
Carbon Footprint Counter, to calculate your daily carbon emission.
# Customize carbonFoots according to your will!
Below are the steps you are required to follow in order to run carbonFoots on your local system:
1) Fork the file or download the zip file in the 'code' section and then extract it to install it in your local system.
2) Move to your bash terminal, and go to the carbonFoots folder 

               eg:  > cd Desktop/carbonFoots-main (I'm assuming the case you downloaded the file and stored on the Desktop folder)
3) Now time to install all the required dependencies by running command as follows:

                  > npm i 
                  This will install all the required dependencies used like Node, Express, Axios etc.
                  
# BOOM! and you are all set to use and customize carbonFoots.
